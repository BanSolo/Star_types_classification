# Star_types_classification
In this project I will classify star types based on dataset from Kaggle.com. 
Kaggel link to dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/deepu1109/star-dataset

Dataset Info(from Kaggle):
This is a dataset consisting of several features of stars.

Some of them are:

Absolute Temperature (in K)
Relative Luminosity (L/Lo)
Relative Radius (R/Ro)
Absolute Magnitude (Mv)
Star Color (white,Red,Blue,Yellow,yellow-orange etc)
Spectral Class (O,B,A,F,G,K,,M)
Star Type (Red Dwarf, Brown Dwarf, White Dwarf, Main Sequence , SuperGiants, HyperGiants)
Lo = 3.828 x 10^26 Watts (Avg Luminosity of Sun)
Ro = 6.9551 x 10^8 m (Avg Radius of Sun)
